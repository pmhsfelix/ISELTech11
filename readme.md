#  An Introduction to WCF Web API  #

Source code for the [2011 ISEL Tech](http://iseltech.e.ipl.pt/) event [presentation] (http://pmhsfelix.github.com/ISELTech11/).

## Notes ##

* Requires [NuGet](http://nuget.org/)

* After opening the Visual Studion solution,
	* Go to `tools/Library Package Manager/Package Manager Console`
	* Execute the `Install-Package webapi.all" command
	
* The solution already had the `webapi.all` packages added to it.
 However, due to redistribution limitations, these packages are not on the github repository.
